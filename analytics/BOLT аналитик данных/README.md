# Assignment Description

Attached is a report extract from our financial program for one month in 2017 (numbers modified).

Please create a report or dashboard which:

1. **compares actuals to budgeted figures monthly and YTD,**:
2. **shows ability to see monthly trends in actuals**

### Detail Level

1. Group company together and per countries
2. 3 months period (min)
3. Revenue, Cost of sales, Total expenses and Profit.

As you only have one month actuals then feel free to use whatever logic to generate those extra 2 months of actuals and 3 months of budgeted numbers.

There are no right or wrong solutions as this is meant to show your way of thinking and how you approach finance data.  Which also means that if you have questions then create your own truth.
