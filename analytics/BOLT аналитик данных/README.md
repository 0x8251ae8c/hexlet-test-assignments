# Assignment Description

Attached is a report extract from our financial program for one month in 2017 (numbers modified).

Please create a report or dashboard that:

1. **Compares actuals to budgeted figures**:
   - Monthly
   - Year-to-date (YTD)
2. **Displays monthly trends in actuals**

### Detail Level

1. Group data by company and by country
2. Cover a minimum period of 3 months
3. Include the following metrics:
   - Revenue
   - Cost of Sales
   - Total Expenses
   - Profit

Since you only have one month of actual data, feel free to generate the additional 2 months of actuals and 3 months of budgeted numbers using any logic you find appropriate.

There are no right or wrong solutionsâ€”this task is designed to showcase your approach to finance data. If there are any ambiguities, feel free to make reasonable assumptions.
